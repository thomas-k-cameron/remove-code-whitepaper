# Use Case
## a. Interface Modernization
Say you want to modernize/improve the software's interface.

Many in-house software ends up lacking the technical documentations necessary to understand the implementation. When you want to find out about the software, company needs to spend a lot of time on salvaging documents about what they had built in the past. 
Thanks to budget constraints, company will not move forward with the project and users will be forced to work on antiquated/weird UI.

By automating the generation of GUI/CLI interface, you can substantially reduce the development cost of the GUI, allowing users to modernize under tight budget constraint.

Not only this improves the productivity, it also save company from potential loss.
E.g. Citibank sent 900 Million USD instead of 7.8 Million USD thanks to bad UI design.

## b. Coherent GUI & Speed Up Development
You no longer need to write GUI. GUI doesn't look the prettiest but it is prettier than randomly copy and pasted code.

Furthermore, you will get a coherent design, as the design is handled by the product.
