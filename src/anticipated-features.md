# Anticipated Features
## a. More Interface Support
I will support other interface, such as Python, C#, COBOR, Open API ... etc

E.g. You write a python code, you throw that python code into my product, then  you end up with a desktop software that you can run the python code from the GUI interface.

## b. Design Variation
Many design scheme has been introduced in the past. I will allow users to generate GUI in different design scheme.

E.g. Material, Fluent, ...etc
