# What am I going to build
My product generates GUI from function signature and/or schema definition.

It looks like this.

E.g.  You write a smart contract for Ethereum in solidity, you give the solidity code to my product and you end up with desktop software and CLI app that can invoke the contract, log the request parameters and the response.

E.g. You wrote a python code but you don't want to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript or C#/WPF for GUI. My software automatically generates the GUI interface for it.

## Use Case
### Development Cost
By automating GUI/Logic mapping, it frees developers from writing redundant code.
Additionally, teams developing GUI primary by copy-and-pasting (trust me, it happens a lot), can stop doing it.

### UI Modernalization
Say you have some software written in C, Java or whatever that comes with an antiquated UI. This product reads the code and generate pretty UI on the fly.

### Continuous UI Upgrade
Modernizing antiquated UI is an expensive, time consuming task.  
This product can continously upgrade the UI, keeping the software up-to-date with the best design standards.

## Use Case and Competitors (includes potential competitors)
### vs Frontend Engineers and No/Low code tools
This product can compete because,
- Does not require human interaction at all
- Maps undelrying logic to user interface which gives coherent UI to users

This product cannot compete when user is looking for tailor made UI that is specific to the context.
For example
- Users want to create tailor made experience with exotic design e.g. Video game UI that is integrated into the 3d world
- Users need the UI that is distinct from their competitors e.g. Netflix GUI 

## Development Road map
- Stablize internal representation of GUI
- Support multiple programming languages such as COBOL
- Support multiple different design schemes e.g. Material Design, Fluent Design (as in windows) ... etc
- Smithy Compatability i.e. allow generation of AWS dashboard

## Case Study
### Citi Bank mistakenly sends 900 million USD instead of 7.8 million thanks to terrible UI 
https://interx-labs.com/citibank-500milliondollarerror-interactiondesign/

Reportedly, Citibank's internal software had one of the most confusing UI, which is cited as the primary cause of the incident.

My product can generate clearner UI, thus, preventing such incident to happen.

## How do or will you make money? How much could you make? 
1. Consultation  
2. License Fees  
3. Hosting

The cost of the product will be less than what the front end engineers would cost.
